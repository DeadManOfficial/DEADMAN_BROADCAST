## SECTION C: ANALOG HORROR COLLECTION (6 Prompts)

*Expanded French broadcast intrusion aesthetic with new scenarios.*

---

### HORROR-01: THE ANCHOR (Original Refined)

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Opens on authentic 1990s French television news set — Channel 7 "Info Sept" branding in lower third, timestamp showing 20:14. A composed female news anchor (40s, professional navy blazer, direct teleprompter gaze) reads evening bulletin under harsh 5600K studio lighting. At 3-second mark, signal corrupts: vertical hold slips 30%, static burst for 6 frames. Screen resolves showing the anchor unchanged, but now a second figure occupies the frame — a man in a distressed gray business suit standing motionless 2 meters behind her right shoulder, face partially obscured by datamoshing artifacts (P-frame corruption creating smear effect). The anchor continues reading, completely unaware. At 7-second mark, the figure's head SNAPS 90 degrees toward camera in 4 frames — movement stutters through artificial frame interpolation — creates 4 ghost images trailing the motion path. Anchor falters mid-sentence, eyes dart to floor monitor. At 11-second mark, the figure's mouth opens to physically impossible width (jaw appears unhinged), revealing pure VHS tracking distortion where interior should be — horizontal tear line oscillates across face. The anchor breaks character, whispers "Ce n'est pas dans le script" (This isn't in the script) — voice compressed through damaged audio codec creating artifacts. Final 2 seconds: Both figures FREEZE mid-motion as broadcast hard-cuts to EAS color bars, 1kHz emergency tone, screen text: "VEUILLEZ PATIENTER".
```

---

### HORROR-02: THE WEATHER MAP (Original Refined)

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Channel 6 "TéléSix" weather segment in progress, timestamp 19:47. Two presenters visible: male meteorologist (50s, gray suit, pointer in hand) and female co-host (30s, bright dress) gesture at chromakey weather map showing France with animated pressure systems. At 2-second mark, one studio fluorescent tube audibly pops (sound included), lights flicker. When illumination returns, a third figure has materialized: a field reporter in tan coat holding microphone marked "TéléSix", standing frozen at the edge of the weather map frame, facing AWAY from camera. Presenters continue without acknowledging. At 5-second mark, all three figures begin synchronized micro-movement — heads tilting left in perfect unison at 0.5 degrees per frame — creating stutter-loop echo effect as movement repeats. At 8-second mark, field reporter's head begins rotating through body — face passing THROUGH shoulder mesh like corrupted polygon model — completes impossible 360-degree revolution while body remains completely static. At 11-second mark, all three faces simultaneously turn to camera and MERGE into single kaleidoscope pattern — six eyes arranged in spiral, three mouths overlapping. Audio: original broadcast audio slows to 70% speed with pitch-drop, overlaid with subsonic 18Hz hum (viewer unease frequency). Final frame: broadcast resumes perfectly normal mid-sentence, presenters smiling, field reporter gone.
```

---

### HORROR-03: THE MEME (Original Refined)

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Channel 8 "Huit Direct" news hour, timestamp 21:03. Silver-haired male anchor (60s, authoritative presence, three-piece suit with pocket square) reports on economic policy. Lower third displays stock ticker scrolling left-to-right. At 3-second mark, screen divides without warning — picture-in-picture window opens in top-right showing grainy doorbell camera footage: an elderly grandmother waving at camera with exaggerated enthusiasm, absurdist internet humor style, completely tonal mismatch. Anchor pauses, confused, glances off-camera, attempts to continue. At 6-second mark, the doorbell footage grandmother FREEZES mid-wave — her image begins applying "deep-fried" JPEG artifacts to the main broadcast — oversaturation bleeds outward from PIP window into news studio — anchor's face shifts through green and red color channels in sequence. At 9-second mark, grandmother in PIP slowly turns head to face the main anchor THROUGH the screen — breaks dimensional barrier — her pixelated hand reaches OUT of the PIP window frame and makes contact with anchor's shoulder. Anchor flinches, breaking journalistic composure. At 12-second mark, both figures face camera directly — grandmother's smile has been COPY-PASTED onto anchor's face, perfect pixel match — creating uncanny valley effect. Audio: news theme distorts into chiptune melody, distant "Amogus" reverb. Final second: Anchor breaks fourth wall, defeated whisper: "Je ne comprends pas l'internet."
```

---

### HORROR-04: THE TEST PATTERN

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Opens on Indian Head test pattern (authentic 1950s design), 1kHz test tone steady. Timestamp in corner: 02:34 — dead of night broadcast. At 3-second mark, test tone begins wavering in pitch (subtle at first, then pronounced). At 5-second mark, the Indian Head image begins BREATHING — circular elements contract and expand slightly, geometric shapes pulse with organic rhythm. At 7-second mark, a hand slowly emerges from the center circle — reaching TOWARD the viewer through the screen — fingers stretching beyond test pattern boundaries. Hand appears to be composed of static itself, form shifting between frames. At 10-second mark, the hand STOPS, frozen inches from implied screen surface. A voice emerges from test tone (no visible source): "Nous t'avons vu. Nous arrivons." (We've seen you. We're coming.) — voice is multiple speakers in unison, slight delay between them. At 13-second mark, hand suddenly RETRACTS at impossible speed, test pattern snaps back to normal. Final 2 seconds: test pattern perfectly normal, but the Indian Head's eyes are now OPEN — they weren't before — staring directly at viewer.
```

---

### HORROR-05: THE GAME SHOW

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. French game show "La Roue de la Fortune" (Wheel of Fortune) style set, 1992 aesthetic. Contestant (woman, 30s, floral dress) stands at puzzle board, partially solved phrase visible: "BON_E N_IT" (Bonne Nuit / Good Night). Timestamp: 18:23. Studio audience applause (canned sound). At 3-second mark, contestant calls out a letter: "U!" — but the letter that illuminates is NOT U — the board displays: "AIDEZ-MOI" (Help me) in completely different puzzle. Contestant's smile doesn't change, rehearsed response. At 6-second mark, camera cuts to host (classic game show suit, practiced grin) who is looking directly at camera instead of contestant — his smile is too wide, unmoving while he speaks: "C'est correct!" (That's correct!) — audio/lip sync 3 frames off. At 9-second mark, puzzle board letters begin REARRANGING on their own — revealed letters sliding to form: "ILS NOUS REGARDENT" (They're watching us). Audience continues applauding, canned laughter. At 12-second mark, contestant's head slowly turns 180 degrees (neck rotating fully), face now pointed at camera upside down, smile maintained. Final 2 seconds: Static burst, broadcast resumes mid-episode, different puzzle, everyone normal.

### HORROR-06: THE DEAD CHANNEL

```
15-second VHS broadcast intrusion. Opens on channel that officially doesn't exist — Channel 13 "CANAL MORT" — snow and static filling frame. Timestamp: 00:00 (midnight exact). At 2-second mark, a broadcast emerges from static: a single figure sits in empty black void, facing camera. Figure wears 1960s style suit and tie, face completely in shadow despite no visible light source to create shadow. At 5-second mark, figure speaks directly to viewer (voice is backwards audio played forward, unsettling cadence): "Tu regardes l'écran depuis trop longtemps." (You've been watching the screen too long.) At 8-second mark, figure stands up and walks TOWARD camera — each step forward, video quality degrades — closer = more corrupted. At 11-second mark, figure's face finally enters light: it's the viewer's own face (implied by mirroring camera perspective, face is blurred/obscured but silhouette matches viewer's position). Figure raises hand, points directly at viewer. Final 3 seconds: Figure mouths words "C'est ton tour maintenant" (It's your turn now) — no audio. Static swallows image. Channel returns to snow, but a handprint now visible in the static pattern.

## SECTION D: VIRAL TEMPLATES (5 Prompts)

*Mind-bending shots designed for maximum scroll-stop impact.*

---

### VIRAL-01: THE GLITCH TRANSITION (Refined)

```
Photorealistic extreme macro of human eye reflecting screen content. Pupil dilates from f/2.8 to f/1.4 equivalent as reflection content GLITCHES — fragmenting into RGB channels, horizontal tear, datamosh artifacts. A single tear forms at inner corner, but instead of rolling down naturally, it pixelates at 8-bit resolution and dissolves into ascending data particles that float upward. The iris color shifts through unnatural spectrum sequence: electric blue → deep purple → warning amber → static gray → returns to natural brown but now contains scrolling code visible in iris texture. Catchlight in eye shows source screen clearly: DEADMAN BROADCAST logo flickers. Background: pure void black. Camera: 100mm macro, f/2.8, extreme shallow depth, locked tripod, subject eye fills 80% of frame. Lighting: single harsh blue-white source simulating screen, creates bright catchlight and rim light on iris edges, rest of face invisible in darkness. Color: skin tones desaturated, eye colors hyper-saturated during shift sequence. Duration: 10 seconds. Motion choreography: Beat 1-2: Normal eye, slight natural movement. Beat 3: Pupil dilation begins. Beat 4-5: Glitch occurs in reflection. Beat 6-7: Tear forms, pixelates. Beat 8: Data particles rise. Beat 9: Iris color shift sequence. Beat 10: Hold on final image with code visible.
```

---

### VIRAL-02: THE CORPORATE DECAY

```
Photorealistic medium shot of figure walking forward through pristine corporate hallway. With each step, the environment BEHIND the walker decays — walls crack, paint peels in time-lapse speed, LED lights transition to flickering fluorescent to exposed bare bulb to sparking wire. Carpet transitions from fresh to stained to torn to concrete beneath. The figure's reflection in passing windows shows DIFFERENT versions of themselves: one step shows them younger, next step shows them in different decade's clothing, next shows them elderly, next shows them as skeleton in suit. Walker maintains perfect forward focus with mechanical precision, never acknowledging transformations. Camera: Steadicam follow shot, 35mm lens, maintains constant 6-foot distance from figure's back, smooth continuous movement, NO CUTS, claustrophobic persistence. Color: foreground (walker) maintains consistent corporate neutral, background shifts from warm modern tan to cold institutional green as decay progresses. Final frames: figure approaches door marked "EXIT" — reflection shows door marked "NO EXIT" — figure pushes through, HARD CUT to white.
```

---

### VIRAL-03: THE INFINITE SCALE (Refined)

```
Continuous unbroken take through physically impossible scale changes. Opens on: a raindrop falling toward city pavement — camera SHRINKS, passing through water surface tension — now inside the droplet, city skyline reflected on curved interior surface — camera continues shrinking to molecular scale — water molecules visible as abstract shapes — PASSES THROUGH one molecule and emerges at human scale inside the reflected building from the droplet's surface — now inside an apartment where a CRT television displays news footage — camera PUSHES INTO the TV screen, passes through glass — emerges ON the news studio set — passes THROUGH the glass teleprompter — INTO the scrolling text itself — letters become massive architectural structures — camera navigates between sans-serif letterforms at building scale — exits through the period at the end of a sentence — period becomes a sphere, then a planet — camera pulls back revealing solar system — continues pulling back — galaxy — universe — the universe becomes a pixel on a screen showing the original raindrop falling. Seamless loop. Total: 10 seconds. Motion: constant fluid forward movement, speed varies (faster during scale transitions), never stops. No cuts.
```

---

### VIRAL-04: THE UNCANNY INTERVIEW

```
Photorealistic medium shot of generic corporate spokesperson giving interview. Everything is almost perfect: professional lighting, clean backdrop, confident delivery. But subtle wrongness accumulates: blink rate too slow (every 4 seconds exactly), smile micro-adjusts at regular intervals like refresh rate, skin has slight plasticity suggesting deepfake, eye contact with camera is TOO perfect (no natural drift). At 5-second mark, they glitch for 2 frames — same face but different hair color — continues seamlessly. At 8-second mark, audio and lip sync slip 2 frames apart — they continue as if nothing happened. Final second: they say "Have a wonderful day" but mouth clearly says "Help me". Freeze on final frame. Camera: Standard interview 50mm framing, locked tripod, professional but somehow wrong. Lighting: Three-point interview setup but shadows don't quite align correctly (subtle). Color: Oversaturated corporate blue in background, skin tones slightly too uniform. Motion: Minimal natural human movement, emphasis on uncanny stillness. Audio: (implied for video generation) voice has slight artificial compression throughout.
```

---

### VIRAL-05: THE DEVICE STACK

```
Photorealistic static shot of device stack showing screens-within-screens recursive nightmare. A laptop displays a phone, which displays a tablet, which displays a monitor, which displays a TV, which displays a handheld console, which displays a smartwatch, which displays a VR headset view. All screens show the SAME CONTENT: DEADMAN BROADCAST footage — but each smaller screen is 0.5 seconds BEHIND the larger one, creating temporal echo effect. The outermost device (laptop) shows footage of someone watching the same device stack — implying viewer is inside the recursive loop. Every few seconds, all devices GLITCH simultaneously but with different artifacts per device era (CRT static on TV, dead pixels on LCD, VR tracking loss). Camera: Static tripod shot, 50mm lens, deep focus f/8.0 to keep all devices sharp, slight wide-angle distortion suggesting viewer is also on a screen. Lighting: Each device provides its own light contribution, composite illumination, no external source. Color: Each screen generation has era-appropriate color cast (warm CRT, cool LCD, oversaturated OLED). Motion: Beat 1-4: Establish recursive stack, temporal offset visible. Beat 5: First simultaneous glitch. Beat 6-8: Content plays, echo effect visible. Beat 9-10: Second glitch, final frame freezes showing viewer's silhouette visible in screen reflections.
