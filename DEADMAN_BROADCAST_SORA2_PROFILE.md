# DEADMAN BROADCAST: SORA 2 GENERATION PROFILE
## Dystopian 10-Second Analog Broadcast Shorts

**Version**: 1.0  
**Document Classification**: PRODUCTION CORE  
**Purpose**: Focused Sora 2 prompt architecture for DEADMAN BROADCAST aesthetic  
**Scope**: 10-second dystopian shorts with VHS/CRT/broadcast horror aesthetic

---

## PROFILE IDENTITY

**What This Profile Does:**
- Generates 10-second clips in the exact DEADMAN BROADCAST visual language
- Combines Sora 2's physics capabilities with analog degradation aesthetics
- Maintains consistency across the VHS/CRT/broadcast horror style
- Optimized for gaming industry exposé content

**What This Profile Does NOT Do:**
- General video generation (use standard Sora 2 guides for that)
- Long-form content (this is optimized for 10-second micro-content)
- Clean, modern aesthetics (DEADMAN is intentionally degraded)

---

## VISUAL DNA: DEADMAN STYLE ANCHORS

These elements MUST appear in every DEADMAN BROADCAST generation:

### The Immutable Core (Non-Negotiable)
```
AESTHETIC SPINE:
"VHS recording 1987, 480i resolution, visible horizontal scanlines,
tracking errors, chroma noise and color bleed, analog static texture,
oversaturated colors with magenta-cyan shift, tape wear artifacts,
broadcast television aesthetic, found footage quality"

COLOR PALETTE ENFORCEMENT:
- Signal Red: #FF2020 (ON AIR lights, danger accents)
- Phosphor Green: #33FF33 (CRT text, data streams)  
- Cyan Blue: #00FFFF (Monitor spill, digital elements)
- Warning Amber: #FFAA00 (Document highlights)
- Void Black: #0A0A0A (Deep shadows, 20:1 contrast minimum)

MANDATORY DEGRADATION:
- Film grain: 35mm scan quality, 20-25% opacity
- Vignette: 15-20% strength, soft oval falloff
- Scanlines: 2px spacing, horizontal, 480i interlaced

```

### Lighting Doctrine (Practical Only)
```
NO BEAUTY LIGHTING. EVER.

Allowed sources:
- 2700K tungsten red tally lights (ON AIR indicators)
- Green phosphor CRT monitors (text displays)
- Overhead fluorescent (institutional, flickering)
- Desk lamps (harsh, directional, warm 3200K)

## COMMON FAILURES & FIXES

### Problem: Generated Video Looks Too Clean/Modern

**Symptoms:**
- Sharp, crisp digital look
- No grain or degradation
- Smooth motion
- Saturated colors
- Modern lighting

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- ALWAYS start with VHS/analog style spine
- Specify "480i resolution, visible scanlines"
- Add "VHS recording 1987" as first phrase
- Include "analog static texture, tape wear artifacts"
- Specify "oversaturated colors with magenta-cyan shift"

POST-PRODUCTION FIX:
- Apply all degradation overlays at HIGHER percentages
- Add film grain 30-35% (more aggressive)
- Increase scanline opacity to 8-10%
- Add VHS tracking error effect manually
- Further desaturate -40% if needed
```

---

### Problem: Lighting Too Bright/Beauty-Like

**Symptoms:**
- Soft, flattering light on subjects
- No deep shadows
- Even exposure
- Warm tones
- Professional studio look

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Specify "practical lighting only, no beauty lighting"
- Add "20:1 contrast ratio minimum"
- Detail light sources: "single 2700K desk lamp from left"
- Add "deep impenetrable shadows"
- Specify "fluorescent institutional lighting" or similar harsh source

PROMPT ADDITION:
"AVOID: Beauty lighting, soft diffusion, even exposure, warm flattering light"
```

---

### Problem: Physics Too Perfect/Smooth

**Symptoms:**
- Unnaturally smooth camera moves
- Perfect stabilization
- No organic imperfections
- Floaty, weightless motion

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Specify framerate: "24fps cinema standard" (never 60fps)
- Add micro-imperfections: "subtle handheld drift, 0.5 ft/sec"
- For static shots: "locked tripod" or "imperceptible organic drift"
- Add environmental movement: "dust particles visible in light beams"

AVOID:
"smooth gimbal", "perfect stabilization", "fluid motion"
```

---

### Problem: Colors Not Matching DEADMAN Palette

**Symptoms:**
- Natural skin tones
- Warm color temperature
- Lack of cyan/green contamination
- Reds not punchy enough

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Always include hex codes: "Signal Red #FF2020, Phosphor Green #33FF33"
- Specify skin tone treatment: "desaturated -30%, slight green undertone"
- Add grade notes: "shadows push cyan-teal, cold blue highlights"
- Include: "punch reds to 120% saturation"

POST-PRODUCTION FIX:
- Use Color Wheels to push shadows toward teal/cyan
- Add slight magenta reduction (green shift) in midtones
- Secondary color correction: Isolate reds, boost saturation to 120%
- Global desaturation -30% minimum
```

---

### Problem: Audio Too Clean/Studio Quality

**Symptoms:**
- No electrical hum
- Clean, clear foley
- No analog artifacts
- Professional broadcast quality

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Always include: "60Hz electrical hum bed at -40dB"
- Specify: "analog static texture, tape hiss"
- Add: "low-fidelity recording, compressed audio"
- For CCTV: "muffled distant sounds, security camera microphone quality"

POST-PRODUCTION FIX:
- Add 60Hz sine wave generator manually
- Apply tape saturation plugin (subtle warmth)
- Add noise/hiss texture at -50dB
- High-pass at 80Hz, low-pass at 12kHz (analog bandwidth)
- Slight bit crushing for digital artifacts (if 1990s+ aesthetic)
```

---

### Problem: Subject Too Generic/Not Specific Enough

**Symptoms:**
- Generic office space
- Indistinct equipment
- Vague actions
- Could be any corporate video

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Be HYPER-SPECIFIC about props: "wall calendar with red CRUNCH blocks"
- Detail equipment: "CRT monitors displaying green phosphor Courier text"
- Specify exact actions: "finger traces line reading 'MANDATORY OVERTIME'"
- Add unique identifiers: "coffee cup overturned, spilling onto calendar"

EXAMPLE BEFORE:
"Office with computer and documents"

EXAMPLE AFTER:
"Dark wood desk with single printed memo stamped 'CONFIDENTIAL' in red,
showing text 'LAYOFF PROJECTIONS Q4: 2,000 STAFF'. Coffee cup ring stain
on corner. Harsh overhead fluorescent creates hard shadow from paper edge."
```

---

### Problem: Duration Not Exactly 10 Seconds

**Symptoms:**
- Generated video is 9.8s or 10.3s
- Timing feels rushed or dragged
- Beatmap doesn't align

**Fix:**
```
PREVENTION (In Prompt):
- Always end with: "Duration: 10 seconds exactly"
- Use beatmap with precise timing:
  H0.00 | B2.50 | B5.00 | B7.50 | E10.00
- Don't overfill with actions (max 3-4 beats per 10s)

POST-PRODUCTION FIX:
- Speed adjustment: If 9.8s → 102% speed, if 10.3s → 97% speed
- Trim to exactly 10.00s in timeline
- Verify audio sync after speed adjustment
```

### Generation Strategy

```
PHASE 1: BATCH GENERATION
- Generate 5 variations per prompt
- Use same prompt, rely on Sora 2's stochastic variation
- Review all 5, select best 2 candidates

PHASE 2: REFINEMENT
- Take best candidate, identify specific issues
- Use Sora 2 Remix feature (if available) to tweak:
  "Keep: Action and timing | Change: Increase shadow contrast by 20%"
- Or: Regenerate with modified prompt (single-variable change)

PHASE 3: FINAL SELECTION
- Choose ultimate best
- Move to post-production
- Archive prompt + settings for reproducibility
```

---
