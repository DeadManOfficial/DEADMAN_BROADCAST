## TIPS FOR FASTER PROMPTING

**Use Keyboard Shortcuts:**
1. Copy template letter (A-G)
2. Fill in ONLY your specific details
3. Keep style spine/color/audio foundation unchanged
4. Generate 3-5 variations

**Common Mistakes:**
- Over-specifying (let Sora fill some blanks)
- Under-specifying subject (be hyper-specific on key elements)
- Forgetting negative constraints (always add avoids)
- Skipping beatmap timing (actions need structure)

**Speed Tips:**
- Keep a file of your successful prompts
- Copy sections between related shots
- Use template quick-fills when appropriate
- Don't reinvent the wheel - adapt proven prompts
